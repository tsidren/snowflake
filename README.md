# snowflake
I got to know about this in a reel and wanted to try this. [^1]

The reel stated, that to make pentagon vertices, choose two non-adjacent vertices 
and create a dot at the (1/3) distance of those selected vertices.
then select a vertex randomly and again create the dot between the previous dot and the chosen vertex.
repeat this multiple times and you will get a snowflake structure. 

### Conclusion 
Either I did something wrong or this was wrong. :smile:

## Initial Setup 
### Python programs 
- For installing Python in your system follow [this](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?t=109&si=nSMND0BaJhe_u5CS)

## test drive 
- Run "main.py" from the initial directory.

[^1]: I've tried my best to make the programs user-friendly. (Please read the programs and also change them accordingly)
